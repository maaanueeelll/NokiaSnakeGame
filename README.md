# Nokia Snake Game

Back in 1998, Nokia decided to release a version of the classic snake game on its mobile devices. Since then, the format has exploded in popularity, with hundreds of different versions available on the various app-stores. This version of the game is in HTML5,CSS & JS and therefore playable on any device with a web-browser. It looks exactly the same as it did on the old Nokia 3310! You’ll take control of a growing snake that slithers across a grid. Eat food and you’ll grow longer (and speed up). The more food you eat, the more difficult it gets – and this is a game that’s easy to pick up but still offers a challenge after hours of practice.

This is a simple vanilla JavaScript fully functional game created mainly as a practice on JS. In this project we made:
* project set up
* event listeners
* query Selectors
* arrow functions
* forEach
* setting time intervals and countdowns
